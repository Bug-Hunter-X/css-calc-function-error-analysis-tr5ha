The CSS `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works fine, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will fail because the `10` lacks a unit.  Another issue arises when combining different units within the same `calc()` expression without proper conversion.  For instance, `margin: calc(50% + 2em);` could lead to unexpected layouts due to the inherent differences between percentages and ems.
